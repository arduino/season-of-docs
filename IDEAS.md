## List of Ideas



### Document third-party libraries

There are hundreds of contributed libraries within the Arduino ecosystem. Those that are downloaded the most are typically having great documentation. However, there are still many libraries, both Arduino-made and contributed that do not expose all of their potential towards developers. While they have a more than decent (sometimes great) documentation for end-users, they need to have better documentation for potential contributors.

Open source is good because it allows looking inside, but the one reason to look inside the guts of a library is to understand how it works to see whether it does what you want to do and, if not, figure out how to improve it to make it accommodate your own needs.

### Document Arduino cores
How are Arduino cores done, and how to make them your own is something that we cover in a slightly superficial way on the Arduino website. We have increased the number of cores we have in our ecosystem over the years but there is still little about the philosophy of why they are made the way they are. It would be interesting to have some documentation made on this topic, also for our own hardware architects to-be to understand what makes a board an Arduino one.

### Greatest hits from the Arduino Playground
The Arduino Playground was an active public wiki that was open for editing by anyone in the Arduino community between 2006 and 2019. With the growth of the community and the arrival of new platforms for information exchange, the wiki became hard to manage and the decision was made of freezing its content as new infrastructure was planned to contain new relevant information about Arduino. The goal of this initiative is to select - based on browsing data and quality of the contribution- the most relevant pages from the Playground and migrate them, after corrections and updates to Arduino’s new Documentation platform or Project Publishing platform. While the old wiki will stay there for as long as the Internet exists, the new platform will be a better way to get our community to interact and continue to actively document the Arduino related OS projects, libraries, and tricks.

### Camera, Action!
This is another “Collect, Curate and Reorganize the documentation” project.

Our users are producing an increasing number of videos that span from the basic “how to” to more complex step by step projects assemblies. The different sources and videos could be remixed into structured groups, commented and sequenced by topic. As an example, we chose a topic about Ultrasound distance measurement; we start describing with text the theory, we show some video that proves it, then we offer a basic, intermediate and difficult projects all based on the same technology, showing selected and tested content in the “remixed” form explained below. Choosing a set of Sensors and Actuators as topics could easily create a multimedia based “Getting Started with Arduino” Content. To make the content more compelling and useful, we would like to develop a new style where text is used to express concepts, explain or remark issues and video is used to show the “hands on” part or the passages where “a video is worth a thousand words”. This “remix” activity could split the videos in parts and chapters where the text complements and helps to focus the video content. Proper integration of text and video would grant the full understanding of the content and offer a good multimedia experience. This approach also put the user back in control of the pace at which information is received and digested.

### Translate the Arduino Language Reference
The Arduino Language Reference contains the documentation of the programming language Arduino sketches are written in. In order to make Arduino more accessible to everyone, Arduino would like to translate the Language Reference content to other languages. We're looking for people with fluency in English in addition to any other language (except German and Portuguese, for which we have completed translations) to help with this effort.

Translators are encouraged to suggest any potential improvements to the content they identify during the course of their work. Improvements are first made to the English language content and then pushed out to all the translation repositories from there.

The Language Reference content is written in the AsciiDoc markup language and stored in a GitHub repository. The translations are published to the arduino.cc website.

### Document the Arduino IDE's themes system

Themes define the look of the Arduino IDE. Through the IDE's themes system, colors, fonts, and button graphics may be customized. Custom themes are used not only to make the Arduino IDE look cool; they can also increase the accessibility of the Arduino IDE to those with visual impairment. No official documentation of the Arduino IDE's theme system exists currently, making it intimidating for users to get started with customizing themes.

The project is to create a user-friendly guide to:
-   The purpose of each theme property    
-   Customizing button graphics files   
-   Installing custom themes

The documentation will be written in Markdown and published in Arduino's wiki in the arduino/Arduino Github repository.

## Technical Writer abilities

- Should have some knowledge about microcontrollers   
- Should have some knowledge about programming
- Should have some basic knowledge about electronics
  1. Why? -> you should understand what you are reading and writing about
  2. Why? -> to explain something to someone you have to be knowledgeable about it
- Should be willing to study or get some basic info on topics he is not familiar with
- Should be able to summarize or expand any written text
- Should be able to transform a complex topic into an understandable series of concepts
- Should follow the standards for units, measures and technical acronyms (e.g: megohm, FFT … etc)
- Should respect our founding values and agree on them (what is Arduino, its ecosystem, Open Source, “sharing is caring” …)
- Should respect the basic rules of writing and journalism: report facts and keep opinions for himself; an attitude for fact checking would be very welcome.
